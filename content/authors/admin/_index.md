I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/">Computer Science</a> department at Florida State Universtiy, where I am lucky to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~liux/">Professor Xiuwen Liu</a>. During my studies, I would like to answer fundamental questions related to enabling machines to become more adept at human language. My research area includes Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Intelligent Systems in general. Currently, I am focused on self-supervised representation learning, analysis of representations learned by language models and text summarization. 

Before starting my doctoral studies, I completed an internship at Samsung R&D, where I worked on advancing Dialog Systems. 

Outside of academia, swimming has been my lifelong passion. I was a Polish National Championship medalist, Poland's National Swim Team Member, and competed at NCAA Division 1 athletics as a member of the varsity swim team at Florida State University.
